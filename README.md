## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

On this project, my javascript knowledge has increased, though I still need more work on code refactoring and minification. 
Additionally, below are the following things I learned:
- I learned how to add animation for counters.
- Used clamp to add autoscale texts
- Basic calendar logic

### Continued development

I'm going to tackle more challenge in frontendmentor.io to further enhance my coding skills. Im still in the stage of beginner, actually if theres a stage before the beginner, thats where Im at.

## Acknowledgments

The courses I have undergone in Udemy with Dr. Angela is helping me a lot. Had couple of notes during that bootcamp and I'm now they are helping a lot since I can't remember most of the syntaxes.

Additionally, I got some solution in stackoverflow (cant remember the thread though) for the leapyear logic of the calendar.
